## 🧩 Lab Title
**Git and GitHub Operations**

---

## 🖥️ Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand and perform essential Git and GitHub operations, including repository creation, branching, SSH configuration, collaboration workflows, and branch management using both Git Bash and GitHub GUI.

---

## ⚙️ Tasks Performed

### ✅ Task 1: Create Private GitHub Repository
A new private repository was created on GitHub to securely manage source code and files.  
*(Refer to Figure 1: GitHub Repository Creation Screen)*

### ✅ Task 2: Connect Repository via SSH
SSH keys were generated and added to GitHub for secure authentication without using passwords.  
*(Refer to Figure 2: SSH Key Setup and Connection)*

### ✅ Task 3: Configure Git Username and Email
Global Git configuration was set using the following commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```  
This ensures commit authorship is correctly tracked.  
*(Refer to Figure 3: Git Config Screenshot)*

### ✅ Task 4: Explore the .git Folder
Explored the hidden **.git** directory to understand internal Git structure including branches, logs, and configurations.  
*(Refer to Figure 4: .git Folder View)*

### ✅ Task 5: Local Repository Management
Initialized a new repository, created files, and committed changes using `git add` and `git commit`.  
*(Refer to Figure 5: Local Repository Workflow)*

### ✅ Task 6: File Status & Staging
Used `git status` to check file states and staged changes before committing to the repository.  
*(Refer to Figure 6: File Staging Output)*

### ✅ Task 7: Branch Creation Using GitHub GUI
Created a new branch through GitHub's web interface for isolated feature development.  
*(Refer to Figure 7: GitHub GUI Branch Creation)*

### ✅ Task 8: Branch Creation and Push Using Git Bash
A new branch was created locally using:
```bash
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
git push origin branch-name
```  
*(Refer to Figure 8: Branch Push via Git Bash)*

### ✅ Task 9: Branching & Merging
Branches were merged after review to combine feature updates with the main codebase.  
*(Refer to Figure 9: Merge Confirmation Screen)*

### ✅ Task 10: Pull Request and Branch Review (GitHub GUI)
A pull request was opened, reviewed, and merged using the GitHub interface.  
*(Refer to Figure 10: Pull Request Overview)*

### ✅ Task 11: Detailed Branch Strategy (Develop/Staging)
A branching strategy involving **main**, **develop**, and **staging** branches was outlined for collaborative workflows.  
*(Refer to Figure 11: Branch Strategy Diagram)*

### ✅ Bonus Task: Simulated Team Collaboration
Collaborative actions were simulated, including committing changes on different branches and merging workflows.  
*(Refer to Figure 12: Collaboration Simulation)*

### ✅ Task 12: Code Review Workflow
Performed code review steps such as commenting, requesting changes, and approving updates before merging.  
*(Refer to Figure 13: Code Review Screenshot)*

### ✅ Task 13: Branch Clean-up Best Practices
Deleted unnecessary branches after merging using Git and GitHub GUI to maintain a clean repository.  
*(Refer to Figure 14: Branch Deletion Screen)*
